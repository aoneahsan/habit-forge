# HabitForge ðŸ”¨
*Transform Your Life One Habit at a Time*

## Overview

HabitForge is a revolutionary habit transformation application that combines scientific habit tracking methodology from Charles Duhigg's "The Power of Habit" with powerful visual reinforcement techniques. The app empowers users to identify, track, build, and break habits through data-driven insights and motivational visualization.

## Core Philosophy

Based on the groundbreaking research in "The Power of Habit," HabitForge recognizes that habits consist of three key components:
- **Cue** (The trigger that initiates the behavior)
- **Routine** (The behavior itself)
- **Reward** (The benefit you gain from the behavior)

By tracking environmental and emotional factors, HabitForge helps users identify their habit loops and consciously reshape them.
