## Feature 2: Habit Forge & Breaker

### Purpose
Create powerful visual and emotional reinforcement for habit formation through the metaphor of forging an unbreakable rope.

### Core Components

#### 2.1 The Rope Visualization System

**Visual Metaphor:**
- Each habit is represented as a rope being woven
- Daily completions add strands, making it stronger
- Missed days cause fraying or strand removal
- Visual progression from thread → string → cord → rope → cable

**Rope Characteristics:**
- **Thickness**: Represents consistency
- **Color Intensity**: Shows recent activity (fades without action)
- **Texture**: Smooth (easy days) vs. rough (difficult days)
- **Glow/Shine**: Indicates current streak length
- **Material Evolution**: Cotton → Hemp → Steel cable (metaphorical strength)

#### 2.2 Strength Calculation System

**Habit Strength Formula:**
```
Strength = (Consistency × Streak × Quality) - (Misses × Penalty)
```

**Components:**
- **Base Points**: 1 point per completed day
- **Streak Multiplier**: Increases with consecutive days
- **Quality Bonus**: Based on self-reported quality/intensity
- **Time Decay**: Older entries have less weight
- **Comeback Bonus**: Extra points for returning after a miss

#### 2.3 Adaptive Penalty System

**AI-Driven Penalties:**
- **Early Stage (Days 1-7)**: Gentle - 1 strand lost per miss
- **Building Stage (Days 8-21)**: Moderate - 3 strands lost
- **Establishing Stage (Days 22-60)**: Firm - 7 strands lost
- **Maintenance Stage (Days 61+)**: Protective - 10 strands lost

**Penalty Factors:**
- Previous consistency record
- Reason for missing (illness, emergency, choice)
- User's historical patterns
- Current life stress level
- Recovery speed after misses

**Recovery Mechanisms:**
- "Repair Day": Double effort to restore lost strands
- "Grace Period": 24-hour window for late entries
- "Vacation Mode": Planned breaks without penalties
- "Sick Days": Reduced penalties with reason

#### 2.4 Gamification Elements

**Achievement System:**
- **Milestones**: 7, 21, 30, 60, 90, 365 days
- **Badges**: Early Bird, Night Owl, Weekend Warrior, Comeback Kid
- **Levels**: Apprentice → Journeyman → Master → Grand Master
- **Challenges**: Weekly, monthly community challenges
- **Leaderboards**: Optional competitive elements

**Visual Rewards:**
- Rope material upgrades
- Special effects (sparkles, flames, auras)
- Custom rope colors and patterns
- Trophy room for completed habits
- Before/after comparison gallery

#### 2.5 Habit Breaking Features

**Reverse Mechanics:**
- **Chain Breaking**: Visualize breaking addiction chains
- **Wall Building**: Each day builds a wall between you and the habit
- **Distance Meter**: Shows days/distance from last occurrence
- **Craving Tracker**: Monitor and graph urge intensity
- **Replacement Habits**: Suggest and track positive alternatives
