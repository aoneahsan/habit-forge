## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+ LTS
- Yarn package manager
- Firebase account
- Git

### Local Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/habitforge.git
cd habitforge
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
yarn install
```

3. **Set up environment variables**

yarn test
yarn lint
```

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use strict mode
- All variables and functions must be properly typed
- Avoid `any` type unless absolutely necessary
- Use interfaces over type aliases for object shapes
- Export types separately from implementations

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused (< 500 lines)
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use proper prop typing with TypeScript
- Implement proper error boundaries

### File Organization

```typescript
// 1. Imports - grouped and ordered
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';

// Type imports
import type { User } from '@/types';

// Component imports
import { Button } from '@/components/ui';

// 2. Type definitions
interface Props {
  userId: string;
}

// 3. Component
export function Component({ userId }: Props) {
  // hooks
  // handlers
  // render
}

// 4. Exports
```

### State Management

- Use Zustand for global state
- Use React Query for server state
- Keep state as local as possible
- Avoid prop drilling with context when needed

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS classes
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Maintain consistent spacing and sizing
- Use CSS variables for theming
- Avoid inline styles

### Git Commit Messages

```
