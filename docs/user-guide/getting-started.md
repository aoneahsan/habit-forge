| **Location** | Where you perform the habit | Identifies environmental triggers |
| **Emotional State** | How you feel before/after | Reveals emotional patterns |

| **Time** | When it happens | Finds optimal timing |
| **Preceding Action** | What happened before | Discovers trigger chains |

### 3. Rope Visualization

- **Grows thicker** with consistent practice

  - Thread (Days 1-7)
