# Project Structure Verification

## ✅ Issue Fixed
The project structure has been successfully corrected. The Vite React project that was mistakenly created in a subfolder has been moved to the root directory.

## Current Structure
```
/home/ahsan/Documents/01-code/haitforge/
├── src/                    # Source code directory
├── public/                 # Public assets
├── node_modules/          # Dependencies (installed)
├── project-development-plan/  # Progress tracking
├── package.json           # Single package.json at root (CORRECT)
├── vite.config.ts         # Vite configuration
├── tsconfig.json          # TypeScript configuration
├── eslint.config.js       # ESLint configuration
└── [other project files]
```

## What Was Fixed
1. ✅ Removed duplicate package.json files
2. ✅ Moved all React/Vite files from habitforge/ subfolder to root
3. ✅ Cleaned and reinstalled dependencies
4. ✅ Ensured single source of truth for package management

## Dependencies Status
- React: v19.1.1 (latest)
- Vite: v7.1.5 (latest)
- TypeScript: v5.9.2 (latest)
- Tailwind CSS: v4.1.13 (latest v4)

## Ready to Continue
