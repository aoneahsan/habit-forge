# HabitForge - Comprehensive Project Documentation
*Transform Your Life One Habit at a Time*

## Project Vision

HabitForge is a scientifically-grounded habit transformation application that combines the research from Charles Duhigg's "The Power of Habit" with innovative visualization techniques and AI-powered personalization. The app helps users identify, track, build, and break habits through data-driven insights and powerful visual reinforcement.

## Core Philosophy

Based on "The Power of Habit," we recognize that habits consist of:
- **Cue**: The trigger that initiates the behavior
- **Routine**: The behavior itself  
- **Reward**: The benefit gained from the behavior

By tracking environmental and emotional factors using the five-factor framework from the book's appendix, HabitForge helps users identify their habit loops and consciously reshape them.
