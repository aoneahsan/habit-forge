# Features Documentation

## Core Features

### 1. Five-Factor Habit Tracking
Based on Charles Duhigg's research, every habit entry tracks:
- **Location**: Where the habit occurred
- **Emotion**: How you felt at the time
- **People**: Who was around you
- **Time**: When it happened
- **Trigger**: What preceded the habit

This comprehensive tracking helps users identify patterns and triggers that influence their habits.

### 2. Rope Strength Visualization
Habits are visualized as ropes that strengthen over time:
- **Thread** (Days 1-7): Fragile beginning
- **String** (Days 8-21): Getting stronger
- **Cord** (Days 22-45): Solid foundation
- **Rope** (Days 46-89): Strong and reliable
- **Steel Cable** (Days 90+): Unbreakable habit

The visualization updates in real-time using D3.js, showing:
- Thickness increases with consistency
- Color intensity reflects habit strength
- Glow effect for active streaks
- Material texture changes as habit matures
